# ClassList Manager (Java)

🎓 A Java-based system to manage student enrollment using both linked lists and hash tables. Supports class operations like merging, duplication, and set-based comparisons.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

Simulates a simple student registration system where each class maintains its own list of students. Users can enroll or unenroll students, deep-copy entire class lists, and perform set operations between multiple classes.
